# drag
Save the HTML code to a file called index.html, the CSS code to styles.css, and the JavaScript code to script.js. Then, open the HTML file in a web browser to see the drag and drop functionality in action.

The code sets up two containers, one for draggable items (container1) and one as the droppable area (container2).
